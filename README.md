# Python Training Programs Repository

This repository contains Python programs from the training program, covering essential programming concepts, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, loops, and functions. It delves into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 

Beyond core Python, this repository explores relational databases with MySQL, covering database principles, SQL syntax, querying, and administration, along with Python integration for dynamic applications. It also provides insights into organizing and extending Python projects using modules and third-party packages from PyPI, emphasizing modular programming benefits.

Furthermore, the repository includes comprehensive guides on file handling in Python, covering reading, writing, and exception handling using try-except blocks. It also offers practical exposure to data analysis and web scraping, enabling learners to retrieve data from multiple sources, perform Exploratory Data Analysis, handle categorical and ordinal features, and utilize tools like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
